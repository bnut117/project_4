# project_4
Project for Sprint 4

The goal of this project was to analyze the data given on US vehicles for sale.

Some preliminary/ionitial EDA was performed on the given data, as shown in attached Jupyter notebook
    A scatter plot was created to show the spread of odometer readings to days listed on the market
    A histogram was created to show the price of cars and how many cars at each price tier

The tool created will toggle the information as shown for each chart.

Additionally, the first 100 entries are shown for reference.

Libraries needed to implement include, but are not limited to:

    import pandas as pd
    import plotly.express as px
